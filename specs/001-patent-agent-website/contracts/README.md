# API Contracts

**Feature**: 001-patent-agent-website

## Status: Not Applicable

This feature is a static website with no backend API. All content is served as static HTML/CSS/JS files directly from Cloudflare Pages CDN.

**No API contracts required because**:
- No server-side processing
- No database interactions
- No form submissions (mailto: link only)
- No user authentication
- No dynamic data fetching

If future features require APIs (e.g., contact form backend), contracts would be defined here.
